# Cloudflare Blog Webhooks

Cloudflare's Discord has a channel that can notify you when new posts are created. But there's no way to filter out the posts you don't care about.

This project lets you subscribe to specific blog post tags to ensure you only receive notificatiions for the posts you care about.
